** Install

Download evil-emacs-cursor-model-mode.el, open and install it with (package-install-from-buffer).
Add the following code to your init.el:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'evil-emacs-cursor-model-mode)
  (evil-emacs-cursor-model-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Cursor models

Vim works with two cursor models.
A cursor /on top of/ characters model in normal-state and /between/ characters in insert-state.
The evil-emacs-cursor-model-mode unify these to a cursor between model in all states.

Furthermore it becomes natural to change some keybindings in this framework.
I preserve evil-mode's /modal/ interface!

** Keybindings

Even though or maybe because I come from the Emacs world, I don't like layers.
=<shift>= just like =<ctrl>= is a layer and I try to minimize the use of them in keybindings.
To do this the mode will change three keybindings in evil-mode's normal-state keys.

*** The =a= binding

First and foremost Vim's =a= in normal-state makes little sense in this mode.
Evil-mode's (evil-append) is just =l= (evil-forward-char) and =i= (evil-insert).
That is how you should think if you adopt the mode's cursor model.

Therefore I bind (evil-append-line) to =a=.

Entering insert-state at the end of line (evil-append-line) makes sense, whereas (evil-append) does not.
The mode has the keymap evil-emacs-cursor-model-mode-map where you can rebind =A= if you wish.

*** The =p= and =o= bindings

With the change to =a= it is natural to have a look at =p= too.
When you are not pasting a full line, Vim's =p= makes little sense in this mode.
Move forward and paste is strange to prioritize with a lower case binding.

Therefore I swap evil-mode's =p= and =P=.

When you use the mode, you might find yourself only using the (evil-paste-before) command to paste.
Vim's need for two paste commands is compensation for the normal-state cursor model.
Other editors only have one paste command and this mode also mainly have one.
(evil-paste-after) is still bound to =P= and can be useful, but you can contextually replace it with =jp= or =lp=.

Last I swap evil-mode's =o= and =O= so they are consistent with =p= and =P= when you paste lines.

*** Summary

These are all normal-state keybindings:

| This mode's binding | Vim's binding | Alternative       | Lisp function       |
|---------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------------|
| =a=                 | =A=           | =$i=              | (evil-append-line)  |
| =A=                 | =a=           | =li=              | (evil-append)       |
| =o=                 | =O=           |                   | (evil-open-above)   |
| =O=                 | =o=           | =jo= and =a<RET>= | (evil-open-below)   |
| =p=                 | =P=           |                   | (evil-paste-before) |
| =P=                 | =p=           | =jp= or =lp=      | (evil-paste-after)  |

Besides these commands the mode manipulate motions so the cursor between characters model will work.
E.g. =E= should bring you to the end of a word rather than between the last two characters of a word.
These manipulations all work seamlessly and should feel natural.

** The line nugget idea

One idea of the mode is to reduce the use of layers and bindings.
When the commands change as described above, you might start to adopt a new philosophy.
The idea is to work with motions among line nuggets.

With this mode the /commands/ focus on the current line and you can replace all layers with motions.
If you want to open the next line you can use =jo= or =a<RET>= which are both two keystrokes, but so are =<shift>o=.
Same works for paste where =jp= can replace the mode's =P=, when you paste a line.

Note that the /motions/ =f=, =t=, =w=, =b=, =e=, and =ge= still have their upper case variants.

The mindset is that you focus and work on the current line.
I feel this logic is easier to comprehend and internalize if you are not a power user.

*** Efficiency

Compared to Vim the efficiency is roughly the same with this mode.
If you need to work with the next line you will need weakly more keystrokes.
When dealing with the current line nugget you might need fewer.
In most situations you will probably solve whatever you want to do, with roughly the same number of keystrokes.

Using a layer increase complexity because it does not only require that you use two keys.
It also adds a restriction on holding down a key while pressing other keys.
The following is not fair, but I find it harder to write "hEll" than "hello".

Ultimately the modal framework focus on editing text (working with the current line) rather than adding new text (working with additional lines).

** Drawbacks

The main drawback is that it will be harder to work efficiently with a vanilla Vi, Vim or evil-mode editor.
The former mentioned muscle memory will work against you.

The mode will also mess with Vim's "verb" → "noun" mindset.
Motions are nouns and usually the idea is to minimize their use.
Replacing layers with motions are in conflict with this idea.

*** Combined command and motion

Vim has commands that combine a functionality with a motion.
A useful application of the command/motion behavior is Vim's =xp= which /swap/ two characters and move the cursor forward.
This is less accessible in this mode because I swap the paste commands (=xP=).

The lisp function (transpose-chars) does roughly the same thing without involving the kill ring.
I bind it to =gs= in my init, but this is /not/ a part of the mode.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (bind-keys
   :map evil-normal-state-map
   ("gs" . transpose-chars))
#+end_src
Vim's default =gs= is (sit-for 1) but evil-mode doesn't implement it.

Note that evil-mode's behavior is still available so e.g. =~= (evil-invert-char) will work on the (char-after) and move forward.

*** Touching delimiters

If you have touching delimiters like "(...)(...)" and your cursor is between them, then =%= will jump back to the first "(".
In this mode there is no evil-mode way to toggle back and forth between the second set of delimiters when the two sets are touching.

*** Visual block

Last the mode does nothing to =C-v= which is still working with a cursor on top of character model.
In practice =C-v= is still usable and useful but it does have bugs tied to motions and the end of line position.

Emacs' =C-x <SPC>= (rectangle-mark-mode) works in insert-state but not in normal-state.
If =C-v= fails I suggest you fall back on marking with =v= and use the =C-x r= bindings.

* Raison d'être speculation

The /line nugget/ mindset will use less commands and the logic is easier to learn and internalize.

Alternatively the reason for the mode might be to introduce Vim or evil-mode.
The mode can make it a better experience to pick up the /modal framework/.

Last Emacs pinky is a real thing and /fewer layers/ might be important.
This will also be helpful to people who use "sticky keys" accessibility.

To me all three reasons are important.
I like line nuggets in a modal framework with few layers.
